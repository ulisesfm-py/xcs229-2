In \texttt{src/01-linearclass/gda.py}, fill in the code to calculate $\phi$, $\mu_{0}$, $\mu_{1}$, and $\Sigma$, use these parameters to derive $\theta$, and use the resulting GDA model to make predictions on the validation set. Make sure to write your model's predictions on the validation set to the file specified in the code.

To verify a correct implementation, consider creating a plot of the \textbf{validation data} with $x_1$ on the horizontal axis and $x_2$ on the vertical axis. To visualize the two classes, use a different symbol for examples $x^{(i)}$ with $y^{(i)} = 0$ than for those with $y^{(i)} = 1$. On the same figure, plot the decision boundary found by GDA (i.e, line corresponding to $p(y\vert x) = 0.5$).\\

Please run GDA on dataset 1. No plot submission required. Your plot should look similar to the following:
